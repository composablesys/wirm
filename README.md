## About

`Orca` is a light-weight, easy-to-use, Rust Library for performing WebAssembly transformations. It uses [wasmparser](https://docs.rs/wasmparser/0.214.0/wasmparser/) and [wasm_encoder](https://docs.rs/wasm-encoder/0.214.0/wasm_encoder/) to parse and encode Wasm components/modules and maintains its own Intermediate Representation.
